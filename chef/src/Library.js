Pour into the unbaked pie shell and bake for about 50 minutes.Notes:* A little cream (about 1\/4 to 1\/2 cup) mixed into a pecan pie filling before baking gives it a richer, lighter texture. * For a sweeter, lighter pie: add more sugar and use fewer pecans; for a denser, less sweet pie: add more pecans and use less sugar. * The buttery flavour and the lard-induced flakiness of a butter and lard crust make it the perfect one for a perfect pecan pie. And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.

Whisk flour, baking power, baking soda, and salt in large bowl.Add shortening to flour mixture; break up chunks with fingertips until only pea-sized pieces remain.  Working in batches, drop butter slices into flour mixture and toss to coat; pick up each slice of butter and press between floured fingertips into flat, nickel-sized pieces.  Repeat until all butter is incorporated; toss to combine.  Freeze mixture (in bowl) until chilled, about 15 minutes.Spray 24-square-inch work surface with nonstick cooking spray; spread spray evenly across surface with kitchen towel or paper towel.  Sprinkle 1\/3 cup of extra flour across sprayed area; gently spread flour across work surface with palm to form thin, even coating.  Add all but 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to flour mixture; stir briskly with fork until ball forms and no dry bits of flour are visible, adding remaining buttermilk as needed (dough will be sticky and shaggy but should clear sides of bowl).  With rubber spatula, transfer dough onto center of prepared work surface, dust surface lightly with flour, and, with floured hands, bring dough together into cohesive ball.Pat dough into approximate 10-inch square; roll into 18- by 14-inch rectangle about 1\/4 inch thick, dusting dough and rolling pin with flour as needed.  Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, fold dough into thirds, brushing any excess flour from surface; lift short end of dough and fold in thirds again to form approximate 6- by 4-inch rectangle.  Rotate dough 90 degrees, dusting work surface underneath with flour; roll and fold dough again, dusting with flour as needed.Roll dough into 10-inch square about 1\/2 inch thick; flip dough and cut nine 3-inch rounds with floured biscuit cutter, dipping cutter back into flour after each cut.  Carefully invert and transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart.  Gather dough scraps into ball; roll and fold once or twice until scraps form smooth dough.  Roll dough into 1\/2-inch-thick round; cut 3 more 3-inch rounds and transfer to baking sheet.  Discard excess dough.Brush biscuit tops with melted butter.  Bake, without opening oven door, until tops are golden brown and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes.  Let cool on baking sheet 5 to 10 minutes before serving.",

Place 1\/2 rounded teaspoon of the tofu mixture in the center of the wrapper. Shape as desired. Set on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth. Repeat procedure until all of the filling is gone.Using a steaming apparatus of your choice, bring 1\/4 to 1\/2-inch of water to a simmer over medium heat. Spray the steamer's surface lightly with the non-stick vegetable spray to prevent sticking. Place as many dumplings as will fit into a steamer, without touching each other. Cover and steam for 10 to 12 minutes over medium heat. Remove the dumplings from the steamer to a heatproof platter and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat until all dumplings are cooked.To make dipping sauce, whisk together ingredients in a small bowl.",

Raise speed to medium and add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.2. Divide batter among pans. Bake until cakes are set and a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool in pans set on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Turn out cakes onto racks and let cool completely.3. Make the caramel: Combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cook, without stirring, until mixture is dark amber, about 14 minutes. Remove from heat, and carefully pour in cream (mixture will bubble violently); stir until smooth. Return to heat, and cook until a candy thermometer reaches 238F, about 2 minutes. Pour caramel into a medium bowl, stir in 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Let cool completely.4. Meanwhile, make the frosting: whisk together cocoa and warm water in a bowl until cocoa dissolves. Beat butter, confections' sugar, and a generous pinch of coarse salt in a clean bowl with a mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in melted chocolate and then cocoa mixture until combined. Let stand for 30 minutes before using.5. Trim tops of cakes using a serrated knife to creat a level surface.
